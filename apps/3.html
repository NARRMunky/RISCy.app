		<h2>Chocolate DOOM</h2>

			Chocolate Doom is a set of conservative source ports for Doom, Heretic, Hexen, and Strife, with a philosophy of preserving the look, feel, and bugs of the vanilla versions of each. Deliberately including very few new features and maintaining all of the limitations of the original DOS versions, Chocolate Doom is of use to level authors creating vanilla-compatible levels, as well as players seeking an authentically retro experience of the game as it was played in the 1990s.
			Chocolate Doom was first started in 2005 by Simon Howard (Fraggle), who remains the project's maintainer. It is co-developed with Fabian Greffrath, who also maintains Crispy Doom, a derivative source port that closely follows Chocolate Doom development, adding features deemed out-of-scope for Chocolate Doom.
			The name is a pun on the phrase vanilla Doom. Originally only a Doom source port, the project has since expanded to include equivalent ports of Heretic, Hexen, and Strife. The latter involved large scale reverse engineering of the DOS Strife executables by James Haley (Quasar) and Samuel Villarreal (Kaiser), a project that subsequently led to a commercial re-release of the game in the form of Strife: Veteran Edition.

			The GNU Image Manipulation Program, commonly known by its acronym GIMP (/ɡɪmp/GHIMP), is a free and open-source raster graphics editor.
			It is commonly used for photo retouching, image editing, free-hand drawing, and converting between different image file formats.
			GIMP is freely available on Windows, Linux and macOS. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL 3.0 or later). The project is supported by a community of volunteers. Users are encouraged to contribute.
			GIMP supports plugins and scripting, allowing users to extend its features and automate tasks. While it is not primarily designed for drawing, some artists and creators still use it for that purpose.

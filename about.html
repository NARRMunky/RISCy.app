		<h2> About </h2>
		<p> RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. 
		The project commenced in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley. It transferred to the RISC-V Foundation in 2015, and from there to RISC-V International, a Swiss non-profit entity, in November 2019.
		Similar to several other RISC ISAs, e.g. Amber (ARMv2) or OpenRISC, RISC-V is offered under royalty-free open-source licenses. The documents defining the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) are offered under a Creative Commons license or a BSD License. </p>
		<p> We are big fans of the RISC-V open source ethos and want to spread the joy of open and free software to all. We created a place to post and manage a list of circulating RISC-V compatible apps primarily for the Linux platform.
		All apps on this site are eitehr Free Open Source Software or Freeware Non-commercial all freely distributable and useable.</p>

The Idea of RISCy.app is to create a website to act as a database for RISC-V apps and the state they currently are on the platform. Currently focused on linux on RISC-V and not other OSes at this time. It is currently a prototype the add app form doesn't do anything.

The Final vision is to collect app info for RISC-V apps and post links and in a app page and have a comments section on the app page via something like disquis to allow users to post comments and fedback about that particular app. Also be able to post apps to be added on the add app page.
